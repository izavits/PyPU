### Added

- Project scaffold: packaging with hatchling and version numbers taken from git tags
  (hatch-vcs), CI on Linux, macOS and Windows for Python 3.11–3.14, and a tag-triggered
  release workflow that publishes to TestPyPI and PyPI.
- `pypu.base.BasePUClassifier`, the interface shared by all models: `fit(X, s)`,
  `predict_proba`, `decision_function` and `predict`.
- `pypu.models.NaivePU`, the baseline that treats unlabeled samples as negatives.
- `pypu.utils.check_pu_labels`, `pypu.utils.check_prior`, `pypu.utils.threshold_from_prior`
  and `pypu.show_versions()`.
